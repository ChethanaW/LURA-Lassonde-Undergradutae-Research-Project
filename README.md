 Signal processing for identifying features in shotgun proteomics
 
Abstract

Shotgun proteomics is a process in which a control/treated protein sample is digested into a peptide mixture and then subjected into high liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. This allowed the protein present in a sample to be identified using the spectral output of the spectrometry reader, which is extremely useful for biological purposes. Currently, there are many algorithms and softwares that detect the protein based on the peptides present.  One of the most difficult challenges is determining whether the sample contains more than one protein. The goal of this study is to develop an algorithm capable of detecting a protein mixture in a given sample. We are attempting to find a solution by utilizing signal processing methodologies. Multiuser detection is a signal processing method that has been used for multiple access purposes by various radio communication technologies, which allows the separation and detection of interfering signals. Developing an algorithm using the multiuser detection method has the potential to aid in the detection of features for multiple proteins present in a mixture. The team decided to use Python to create an algorithm that could be tested on actual proteomic datasets and, if successful, could be used by biologists/chemists to identify multiple proteins in a mixture.
